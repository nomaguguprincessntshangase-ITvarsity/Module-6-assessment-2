          <h4>About us</h4>
          <p>As a business we believe we have to take ownership of the plight of our planet, our country and our communities. This is why we have our eco and social endeavours; and why we have decided we simply have to participate in current relief efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

With a view to making the most meaningful and impactful contribution, we have made donations to the Solidarity fund and Food Forward SA with a view to assisting in the combat of the pandemic, as well as helping the vulnerable South Africans impacted the most by the Lockdown. A further donation has been made to Shout4Masks, a non-profit supplying medical masks to those who are battling this disease on the frontlines.</p>
